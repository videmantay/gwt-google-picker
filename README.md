Google Picker is a "File Open" dialog for the information stored in Google servers.

With Google Picker, your users can select photos, videos, maps, and documents stored in Google servers. The selection is passed back to your web page or web application for further use.

gwt-google-picker is a GWT wrapper for Google Picker.

all credits to the guys from floreysoft.net who wrote 99.99% of the code, but I needed some changes and they don't give any sign of life.
